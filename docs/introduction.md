# Introduction

## What is Cubeta Starter?

Cubeta Starter is a powerful Laravel package designed to accelerate your development workflow by automating the creation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It eliminates repetitive coding tasks and helps you build robust Laravel applications faster.

## Who is it for?

This package is ideal for:
- Laravel developers looking to speed up their development process
- Teams that want to maintain consistent code structure across projects
- Developers who prefer to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code
- Projects that require rapid prototyping and iteration

## Key Benefits

- **Time-saving automation**: Generate complete CRUD operations with a single command
- **Consistent architecture**: Implements Repository and Service design patterns for clean, maintainable code
- **Flexible integration**: Works as either a core component or development dependency
- **User-friendly interface**: Offers both GUI and command-line options for code generation
- **Comprehensive code generation**: Creates all necessary files for each model
- **Multiple frontend options**: Supports Blade/Bootstrap, Inertia/React/TypeScript, or API-only setups
- **Testing ready**: Generates test files to ensure your code works as expected

## What Gets Generated?

For each model you create, Cubeta Starter automatically generates:

- Migration file
- Controller (API and/or web)
- Form request validation
- API resource
- Factory for testing
- Database seeder
- Repository class
- Service class
- Feature test
- Postman collection (for API testing)

All generated code follows Laravel best practices and is ready to use immediately.
