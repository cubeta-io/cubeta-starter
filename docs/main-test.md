# MainTestCase class

> [!attention]
> those methods depends on the model resource and factory and the response of the endpoint to be generated by
> the `RestTrait` and the exceptions thrown by our exception handler.  <br>
> so each model must have a resource and a factory (not necessarily generated by the package) but the endpoint for it
> must be using RestTrait for handling its responses .

- `indexTest(array $additionalFactoryData = [], bool $ownership = false, bool $isDebug = false)` : <br>
  this method will test the index endpoint by creating 5 records of fake data and try to get them

  `$additionalFactoryData` : <br> maybe your model factory doesn't contain info about some columns on your table but
  their exists in the desired response, or you want to test this endpoint on a specific columns values , so this array
  will give you the ability to pass the required columns with their desired value to the factory .

  `$ownership` determine if the action has to be on the authenticated user data so if it has to be, the test will check
  if the ordered data belongs to the current user or not

  `$isDebug`  if it true it will dd() the endpoint response

- `showTest(array $additionalFactoryData = [], bool $ownership = false, bool $isDebug = false)` : <br> the parameters of
  this method are the same of the `indexTest` method
  in brief this function run the model factory and try to get one instance of the model by its `id` .

- `storeTest(array $additionalAttributes = [], mixed $requestParams = null, bool $isDebug = false)` : <br>
  regardless `$additionalAttributes , $isDebug` which we talked about here there is a new
  parameter `$requestParams` : <br>  
  sometimes your endpoint needs a parameter to perform its action like this
  route `/category/{category_id}/products/create` as you see to create a product you have to pass a category id, so you
  can pass it in this parameter and if they were a punch of parameters just pass them as an associative array .


- `updateTest(array $additionalFactoryData = [], array $attributes = [], bool $ownership = false, bool $replacing = true, bool $isDebug = false)` : <br>
  `$attributes` : if your requests needs data that your factory doesn't create it just send those data within this
  parameter, and it will be merged within the test request. <br>
  `$replacing` : sometimes your update endpoint doesn't edit the selected database record it is just create another one
  with the desired edits so if this what happens in your endpoint just make this parameter `false` . <br>

> [!note]
> it is important to mention that the storeTest and updateTest methods generate their requests body data from
> the model factory .

- `deleteTest(array $additionalFactoryData = [], bool $ownership = false, bool $isDebug = false)` : <br>
  all the parameters of this method has explained before . <br>
