# RestTrait

To use the RestTrait in your PHP application, follow these steps:

Include the RestTrait in your controller or service class by adding the use statement at the top of the child class:
php `use App\Traits\RestTrait;` but notice that it is generated by the `cubeta:install api` artisan command .
Implement the methods provided by the RestTrait within your controller or service class.<br>
These methods can be used to
handle API responses and validations. Here's a breakdown of each method:
`apiResponse($data = null, int $code = 200, $message = null, $paginate = null)`: This method creates a standardized API
response. It accepts parameters such as `data, code, message, and paginate` to customize the response. Use this method
to
format and return API responses within your controller or service methods.

`apiValidation($request, $array)`: Use this method to handle request data validation. It takes the incoming request
object
and an array of validation rules as parameters. If the validation fails, it returns an API response with appropriate
error messages. If the validation passes, it returns the validated data.

`formatPaginateData($data)`: This method is used to format pagination data returned by Laravel Paginator class. It
accepts the paginated data and returns an associative array containing fields like `currentPage, from, to, total`, and
`per_page`. Use this method when you need to format pagination data for API responses.

Customize the response messages, HTTP status codes, and validation rules to suit your application's needs. Update the
method parameters and content based on your specific requirements.

By using the RestTrait and its provided methods, you can simplify the handling of API responses, improve code
organization, and ensure consistent response structures and data validations throughout your application.
