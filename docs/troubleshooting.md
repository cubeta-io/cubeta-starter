# Troubleshooting

This guide addresses common issues you might encounter when using Cubeta Starter and provides solutions to help you resolve them quickly.

## Installation Issues

### Composer Dependency Conflicts

**Issue**: Composer reports dependency conflicts when trying to install the package.

**Solution**:
1. Check your Laravel version compatibility with Cubeta Starter
2. Try using the `--ignore-platform-reqs` flag:
   ```bash
   composer require cubeta/cubeta-starter --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```
3. If the issue persists, try updating your dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

### Configuration File Not Published

**Issue**: The configuration file is not available after installation.

**Solution**:
Manually publish the configuration file:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cubeta-starter-config
```

## Generation Issues

### Command Not Found

**Issue**: Artisan reports that the Cubeta Starter commands are not found.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure the package is properly installed
2. Clear the configuration cache:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   ```
3. Regenerate the autoload files:
   ```bash
   composer dump-autoload
   ```

### Files Not Generated in Expected Location

**Issue**: Generated files are not in the expected directories.

**Solution**:
1. Check your configuration in `config/cubeta-starter.php`
2. Ensure the directories specified in the configuration exist
3. Verify you have write permissions to those directories

### Relationship Generation Errors

**Issue**: Errors when generating models with relationships.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure related models exist before creating relationships
2. Check that the relationship types are correctly specified
3. For many-to-many relationships, ensure both models are created first

## Usage Issues

### GUI Not Accessible

**Issue**: Cannot access the GUI at `/cubeta-starter`.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you're in a development environment (the GUI is only available in development)
2. Check your web server configuration
3. Verify middleware is not blocking the route

### Generated Code Doesn't Work

**Issue**: Generated controllers, models, or other files have errors or don't work as expected.

**Solution**:
1. Check that you've installed all required components:
   ```bash
   php artisan cubeta:install api
   # or
   php artisan cubeta:install web
   ```
2. Verify that your database configuration is correct
3. Look for any custom modifications that might conflict with generated code

### Translatable Fields Not Working

**Issue**: Translatable fields are not storing or retrieving translations correctly.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you've configured `available_locales` in `config/cubeta-starter.php`
2. Check that the field is properly defined as translatable in your model
3. Verify the JSON format of your translatable data:
   ```json
   {
     "en": "English value",
     "fr": "French value"
   }
   ```

## Frontend Issues

### Blade Components Not Found

**Issue**: Blade components published by the package are not found.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you've installed the web components:
   ```bash
   php artisan cubeta:install web
   ```
2. Check that the `CubetaStarterServiceProvider` is registered in your `config/app.php`
3. Clear the view cache:
   ```bash
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

### Inertia.js Integration Issues

**Issue**: Problems with Inertia.js integration.

**Solution**:
1. Verify you've installed the React TS stack:
   ```bash
   php artisan cubeta:install react-ts
   php artisan cubeta:install react-ts-packages
   ```
2. Check that the `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware is registered
3. Ensure your frontend dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Database Issues

### Migration Errors

**Issue**: Errors when running migrations generated by the package.

**Solution**:
1. Check your database connection settings
2. Ensure the migration syntax is compatible with your database driver
3. Look for any conflicts with existing tables or columns

### Seeder Errors

**Issue**: Errors when running seeders generated by the package.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure your factories are properly defined
2. Check for any missing dependencies in your models
3. Verify that related models are seeded in the correct order

## Permission Issues

### Role and Permission Setup Errors

**Issue**: Problems with the roles and permissions system.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you've installed the permissions component:
   ```bash
   php artisan cubeta:install permissions
   ```
2. Check that your models use the `HasRoles` trait
3. Verify that the roles and permissions tables are migrated
